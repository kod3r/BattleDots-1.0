- To launch the game, open the file called BattleDots.py and run.
- The file "Start_Server.py" must be run first before launching the game
- Line 16 of the file "BattleDots.py" may need altering so that the display size of the program matches
  that of your screen
- You may need to alter your computers firewall to allow the chosen port through. The port number can be found 
  in the file "Client.py" assigned to the variable "PORT". If you wish to alter the port number, this must be done
  in the "Client.py" and "Server.py" files.

- Whoever will be the client must alter the file "Server.py" by changing the value of the variable
  "HOST" to the value of the host's IP address.
